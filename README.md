# BMI_Calculator
We know that The Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator can be used to calculate BMI values based on height and weight.
To find out BMI we will take input from the user (both height and weight) which will be stored in height and weight variables for further calculation. 
The calculation process is simple, we will simply divide weight in kilograms by the square of the height.

Using HTML we are giving desired structure, an option for the input, and submit button. 
With the help of CSS, we are beautifying our structure by giving colors and desired font, etc.

I have built this calculator to calculate the ratio. Please try it !!

P.S.-
Since Github do not support server deployment, output will not be shown here. Please refer to code . Thanks!!
